# Loan_Approval_System
Another end-to-end Machine Learning project with my project partners Divyesh and Siddharth. A web app predicts the possibility of loan approval of applicants, based on the data provided by them. 


An applicant has to enter some of the mandatory details given in the form:

Gender (Gender of an the applicant (Male/Female))

Maritial Status (Applicant is married or not)

Dependents (How many members are dependent on the applicant's income?)

Education (Whether applicant is graduated or not graduated or under graduation!)

Self Employment (Applicant is employed or not)

Income (Income of the applicant)

Coaplicant Income (Side income earned by the applicant (if any))

Loan Amount (The amount required for loan)

Loan Amount Term (Due of Loan)

Credit History (Reagrding time-to-time payment and credit score)

Property Area (Residential Area of an applicant)

After entering details, user has to click on the "Predict" button to get his/her loan application status.
